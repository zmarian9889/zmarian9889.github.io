    <h1>Marian Zhen</h1>
    <p>I graduated from college and after working for 6 months, I decided to quit my job and move abroad for a year. It was one of the toughest things I did in my life. I lived in rural China and taught English with TFC. Then I came back and decided I wanted to start a start up with a friend.</p>
